## About Me

I am currently a 4th-year PhD student at Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary University of London. I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Simon Dixon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/) and [Dr. Mark Levy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g_ESIWoAAAAJ).  Before that, I was a Research Assistant at the [Music X Lab](http://musicxlab.com/), [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). from 2019 to 2020, supervised by [Dr. Gus Xia](http://www.musicxlab.com/members/gus/). I received the Bachelor of Engineering degree (2015-2019) in Computer Science and Technology from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)). 

My research interests include controllable music generations with diffusions and LLMs, and Multimodal representation learning for music editing.
