## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at ByteDance. My research centers on controllable music generation, music editing, music representation learning, and various MIR tasks. 

I received the PhD degree in [Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Centre for Digital Music (C4DM)](https://www.c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), Queen Mary University of London. I am honoured to be advised by [Prof. Simon Dixon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/) and [Dr. Mark Levy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g_ESIWoAAAAJ). Before that, I was a Research Assistant at the [Music X Lab](http://musicxlab.com/), [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). from 2019 to 2020, supervised by [Dr. Gus Xia](http://www.musicxlab.com/members/gus/). I received the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Technology from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)).
